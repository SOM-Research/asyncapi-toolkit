# AsyncAPI Toolkit
Repository to host the grammar, metamodel, and code generation tools for [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com). 

> _AsyncAPI provides a specification that allows you to define Message-Driven APIs in a machine-readable format. It's protocol-agnostic, so you can use it for APIs that work over Kafka, MQTT, AMQP, WebSockets, STOMP, etc. The spec is very similar to OpenAPI/Swagger so, if you're familiar with it, AsyncAPI should be easy for you._

The tools hosted in this repository aim to provide the toolset necessary to develop Message-Driven APIs following a Model-based approach starting from AsyncAPI specifications.
