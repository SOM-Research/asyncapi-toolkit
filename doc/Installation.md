> https://github.com/SOM-Research/asyncapi-toolkit/releases

### Using the Eclipse installer

First, download the [Eclipse installer](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer) and execute it. Then:

* If your **OS supports drag & drop** of links from your browser (e.g., Windows), you can simply drag any of the setup links below (depending on the version you want to install) and drop it over the title area of the installer.

* If your **OS does not support drag & drop**, simply copy any of the setup links below. While the link is in the clipboard, open the side menu of the installer (the three horizontal lines on the top right corner, or `CTRL + M` / `COMMAND + M`), and select the option _APPLY CONFIGURATION_. There is no need of pasting the link. **Please note** that the _APPLY CONFIGURATION_ menu entry will appear **ONLY** if you copy the setup link **BEFORE** opening the side menu.
